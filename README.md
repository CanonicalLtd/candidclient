Maintenance Stopped
-------------------

Maintenance of candidclient as a separate module has been stopped. This
client is now being maintained as part of the main candid module at
[github.com/canonical/candid](https://github.com/canonical/candid).

The packages in this module are mapped as:

    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1               -> github.com/canonical/candid/candidclient
    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1/candidtest    -> github.com/canonical/candid/candidtest
    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1/params        -> github.com/canonical/candid/params
    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1/redirect      -> github.com/canonical/candid/candidclient/redirect
    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1/ussodischarge -> github.com/canonical/candid/candidclient/ussodischarge
    gopkg.in/CanonicalLtd/candidclient.v1/ussologin     -> github.com/canonical/candid/candidclient/ussologin
